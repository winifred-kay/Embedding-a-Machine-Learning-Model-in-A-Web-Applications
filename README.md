# Introduction/Project Description üé∞

Sepsis is the body's extreme response to an infection. The use of AI and machine learning in disease prediction is very useful to the modern health industry since early prediction/ detection of disease is instrumental in avoid certain unseen bad events with patients. This project describes the use of machine learning to build a model that predict the sepsis status of a patient. The model is built on a historic patient data with identified sepsis status.
# Knowledge On Dataset üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
The datasets has ten features about a patient as seen below, including the sepsis feature that classifies a person with sepsis or not
- [ID: number to represent patient ID]
- [PRG: Plasma glucose]
- [PL: Blood Work Result-1 (mu U/ml)]
- [PR: Blood Pressure (mm Hg)]
- [SK: Blood Work Result-2 (mm)]
- [TS: Blood Work Result-3 (mu U/ml)]
- [M11: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2]
- [BD2: Blood Work Result-4 (mu U/ml)]
- [Age: patients age (years)]
- [Insurance: If a patient holds a valid insurance card]
- [Sepsis: Positive: if a patient in ICU will develop a sepsis , and Negative: otherwise]

# Project Method and Setup üöÄ
Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally. All recommended packages are in the requirement.txt file

You need to have [`Python 3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system (**a Python version lower than 3.10**):

- Windows:
        
        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol ` ; ` but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.
